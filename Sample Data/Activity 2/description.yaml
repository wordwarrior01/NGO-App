  title: "Christmas Celebrations"
  attendees: "School Staff"
  description: "Christmas was celebrated as usual with great job and glee with all the employees of the trust and the students of the school.
		It was a great day and everyone was full of joy. The teachers taught a slightly different portion for the day. 
		Many classrooms were singing carols in corus and stories of Jejus's birth were heard down deep in the corridors. 
                All in all an enjoyable course of the day!"
